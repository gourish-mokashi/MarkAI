MarkAI is an AI-generated image Detection System. It comprises two primary tools:

1. **Watermarking Tool**: Adds a unique watermark to images.
2. **Detection Tool**: Detects the watermark in images to determine if they are AI-generated.

## Project Goal
The ultimate goal of MarkAI is to integrate its watermarking system into many generative AI models. By doing so, our detection system can easily identify any image generated through these models.

## Features
- **Watermarking Tool**:
  - Upload an image to apply a unique watermark.
  - Download the watermarked image with the original file name and a suffix.

- **Detection Tool**:
  - Upload an image to verify if it is AI-generated.
  - Get confidence levels for the detection.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: For building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Lucide React**: For icon integration.

### Backend
- **Express.js**: API handling.
- **Python**: For advanced AI-related operations (if applicable).

### Additional Tools
- **Fetch API**: For seamless API communication.
- **HTML5 File APIs**: For image uploads and downloads.
